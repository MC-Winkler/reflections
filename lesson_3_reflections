When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  -When you want to collaborate with other people
Why might you want to always pull changs manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	-For the same reason that you don't want git to automatically push every commit you make - It may take several commits for you to get your repository to a state where you want to pull it.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	-forks: like a clone, but everything stays on github's servers. Would use when you want to work on someone else's project, to give them credit for the work they did.
	-clones: copies a repo into an empty repo. 
	-branches: Branches exist within a repo and represent different variations of a project.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	-If you go offline you still have access to a recent state of the remote you're connected to.
