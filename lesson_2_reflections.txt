What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	-When you initialize a repository, you create a .git folder in the directory you're currently in. 
	-You need to do this so that there's a file that can hold metadata about the repository you just created.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	-It allows you more control over which files get committed - instead of just committing everything, you can commit only the specific files you want.
